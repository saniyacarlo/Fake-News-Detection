# Fake-News-Detection
ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
This project aims to detect whether a news article is Fake or Real using various machine learning classifiers. It involves cleaning and vectorizing textual data and applying models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The final model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.
