# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using various machine learning classifiers. It involves cleaning and vectorizing textual data and applying models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting**.  
The final model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

- Loads and preprocesses a labeled fake/real news dataset
- Cleans the text using regular expressions and NLP techniques
- Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Trains multiple machine learning classifiers
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy and classification reports
- Saves the best-performing model and vectorizer using **joblib**
- Builds a simple **Streamlit app** to test new inputs

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Joblib  
- Streamlit  
- Google Colab / VS Code
